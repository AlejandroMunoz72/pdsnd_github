### Project Title
Bike Share Data with Pyton

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have become increasingly common and popular in cities worldwide. These systems allow users to rent bicycles for short periods at an affordable price. This flexibility enables people to borrow a bike at point A and return it at point B or, if they prefer, return it to the same location for a leisurely ride. As a result, each bicycle can serve multiple users throughout the day.

Advancements in information technology have made it simple for users to access docking stations to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also generate a vast amount of data that can be analyzed to better understand how these systems are utilized.

In this project, you will work with data provided by Motivate(opens in a new tab), a bike-sharing system operator serving several major U.S. cities. Your goal will be to uncover usage patterns in bike-sharing systems by comparing data from three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

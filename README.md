### Project Title
Bike Share Data in Python

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have rapidly expanded in number and popularity, becoming a key feature of urban mobility across cities worldwide. These systems provide a convenient and affordable way for users to rent bicycles for short periods, catering to a variety of needs—from quick commutes to recreational rides. Users can pick up a bike at one docking station (point A) and return it to another (point B), or opt to bring it back to the original station if they're just out for a casual ride. This flexibility maximizes the utility of each bike, allowing it to be used by multiple individuals throughout the day.

The rise of information technologies has played a critical role in the success of bike-sharing systems. Modern docking stations are equipped with digital interfaces that allow users to unlock or return bikes with ease. Mobile apps and real-time data tracking enhance the user experience by providing information on bike availability, station locations, and route planning. Beyond convenience, these technologies generate valuable datasets that help cities and service providers analyze system performance and user behavior, enabling them to make data-driven improvements to their services.

In this project, you will analyze data provided by Motivate(opens in a new tab), a leading bike-sharing system provider operating in several major U.S. cities. Using this data, you will explore patterns of bike-share usage and compare trends across three major urban areas: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. Your analysis will uncover insights into how these systems are used for commuting, tourism, and recreation, providing a deeper understanding of their role in sustainable urban transportation.
